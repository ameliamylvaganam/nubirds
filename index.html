        <p class="introBg descriptionText">
            Chicago is not the friendliest place for migratory birds. In fact, the city ranks as the deadliest in the US. <br>
            Northwestern's Evanston campus is no exception, where an average of 205 birds die from collisions each fall and spring. <br> <br>
            Some Northwestern buildings are more lethal than others. <br>
            The three pictured below are recorded as the most deadly. <br>

                Northwestern's lakefill is a popular stop for migratory birds looking for rest and shelter. <br>
                Therefore, it is no surprise that many birds fatally collide with buildings proximal to the lakefill.

                Additionally, buildings with a higher proportion of glass are the most deceptive to birds who will mistake the reflective surfaces for sky and trees. <br>
                Migratory birds often come from regions with more open space or forests, so many of them have never seen glass before.

    <p class="descriptionText"> These three buildings have the lethal trifecta: <br>
        proximity to the lakefill, large size, and abundance of glass. <br>
        Together, they cause an average of 152 bird deaths every fall and every spring.</p>

    <div class="Conclusion"> <!--could be fleshed out some more-->
        <h2 class="questionText">Where to go from here?</h2>
        <p class="descriptionText">
            While birds might not understand windows, there is a simple solution. <br>
            Patterned films put onto glass enable birds to avoid windows without disrupting human visibility through the window. <br> <br>

            Pattern films have already made a difference on campus- <br>
            they have successfully reduced bird deaths at Frances Searle and East Kellogg. <br> <br>

            The Sustainability Committee of ASG has organized a campus wide petition to put plastic film on the windows of Mudd Library, <br>
            which makes up over 14% of yearly collisions at Northwestern.

        <p class="descriptionText">
            By signing this petition and spreading awareness throughout our community, <br>
            we can work towards making the Northwestern campus safe for birds.

        <h2 class="questionText">Where does our data come from?</h2>
        <p class="dataBackground descriptionText">
            Our data is collected by <a href="https://www.birdmonitors.net">Chicago Bird Collision Monitors</a>, 
            a group of volunteers dedicated to protecting migratory birds such as the ones crossing Northwestern's campus each fall and spring. Part of this protection is collecting vast amounts of data regarding where and when bird collisions are occuring. It is important to note that the bird collision data is collected by humans and therefore is subject to error and bias. For example, buildings which allure more foot traffic could see more collisions recorded. However, this is to say that, if anything, the data collected by this organization is a lower estimate of the potential true number of collisions recorded quarterly. 
            <br> <br>
            Given the data available to us, our visualizations cover bird collisions recorded between 2017 to 2020. Averages shown in our visualizations were taken only over fall and spring quarters since the majority of collisions occur during those quarters when migratory birds are on the move. For the purposes of our visualizations, we consolidated bird collision direction into strictly North, South, East, and West building side bins, equally dividing NW, SW, NE, and SE amongst those categories for simplicity's sake.
